# WoW Finger

## Description

WoW Finger is an application designed to automate key presses in the game "World of Warcraft". It allows users to configure keys to be automatically duplicated when a button is held down, thus avoiding the need to manually spam the key and helping to preserve your fingers.
## Features

- **Start and Stop the Application:** The user can start and stop the key spamming via a graphical interface.
- **Pause During Chat Typing:** The application detects when the user is entering text in the chat and pauses the key spamming.
